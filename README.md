# portfolio-website

Hello everyone, this is my first project for the Headstarter Fellowship Program! This project is a personal portfolio website that uses a free template provided by HTML5 UP! (url link below) that I have edited to include my personal information and links, as well experience and facts about myself. I will also be attempting to optimize the website for better search engine results, deploying the site on my GitHub account, and adding it to Google Analytics to track user traffic. This is all very new to me, so for now, this is the best I've got. With that said, thank you for viewing this repo and enjoy!
